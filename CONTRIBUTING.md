Although Endless Stars is a Scratch project, it's not on Scratch yet. To work on Endless Stars, do this:

- Click on the green "<> Code" button at the top of this page
- Click "Download ZIP"
- Choose where to save the ZIP file on your computer
- Once it's finished downloading, extract it (you may also create a new folder, move the ZIP into it, and then extract it, which will keep the project files more contained)
- The "Endless_Stars" folder contains the actual project files; to open the project in Scratch (or Turbowarp) do the following:
- Compress the "Endless_Stars" folder (into a ZIP)
- Rename the "Endless_Stars.zip" file to "Endless_Stars.sb3"
- And you're done! Open the file in Scratch (or Turbowarp) and start making changes.

**NOTE:** I'll add how to push your changes back to GitHub soon
